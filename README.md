# üì° indoor-geolocation-b4a

Android application developed in **B4A (Basic for Android)** for indoor geolocation systems based on WiFi signals. Designed for educational and research environments focused on geolocation, signal interpolation, and real-time data filtering.

---

## üöÄ Features

The app operates in **two working modes**:

### 1. üîò Localization OFF Mode (data collection)
- The user manually enters:
  - The **scan point** (number)
  - The **floor/level** (G, L1, etc.)
- The app performs a WiFi scan and sends the results as a JSON message to a configured **MQTT server**.
- Used to **build a WiFi fingerprinting database**.

### 2. üõ∞Ô∏è Localization ON Mode (real-time estimation)
- The app periodically scans for WiFi networks.
- The data is continuously sent to the MQTT server.
- The app **subscribes to a topic** to receive the **estimated position** calculated by the external system.
- Can be used to display the user‚Äôs estimated position on a map or floorplan.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

This project is built using:

### ‚úîÔ∏è IDE & Tools
- **B4A (Basic for Android)** version **>= 11.80**
- **B4XPages framework** (optional but recommended for modularity)
- **Java JDK 11** or later
- **Android SDK** (API level 29 or higher recommended)

### üì¶ Required Libraries
- `MQTT_B4X` (based on Eclipse Paho MQTT)
- `Network` (for connectivity checking)
- `Phone` (for WiFi scan access)
- `JSON` (for serialization of messages)
- `Timer`, `StringUtils`, etc. (standard B4A libraries)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Device Requirements
- Android device with:
  - **WiFi scanning capabilities**
  - **Location permission enabled**
  - Android **API 21 (Lollipop)** or newer

### üöÄ How to Compile
1. Download and install **B4A** from [b4x.com](https://www.b4x.com).
2. Open the `indoor-geolocation-b4a.b4a` project file.
3. Ensure all required libraries are available in the **Libraries** tab.
4. Configure your **bridge** or **USB device** for deployment.
5. Compile and install on a real device (WiFi scanning does not work on emulators).
